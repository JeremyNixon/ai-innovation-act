## (a) Findings

The Congress finds the following:

1. The rapidly developing array of large language models and other interactive AI services available to individual Americans represent an extraordinary advance in the availability of educational and informational resources to our citizens.
2. These services offer users a great degree of control over the information they generate and receive, as well as the potential for even greater control in the future as technology develops.
3. Large language models and other interactive AI services offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse, unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenues for intellectual activity.
4. Large language models and other interactive AI services have flourished, to the benefit of all Americans, with a minimum of government regulation.
5. Increasingly, Americans are relying on interactive AI for a variety of political, educational, cultural, and entertainment services.

## (b) Policy

It is the policy of the United States—

1. to promote the continued development of large language models and other interactive AI services and other interactive media;
2. to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for large language models and other interactive AI services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation;
3. to encourage the development of technologies which maximize user control over what information is generated and received by individuals, families, and schools who use large language models and other interactive AI services;
4. to remove disincentives for the development and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies that empower users to restrict access to objectionable or inappropriate AI-generated content; and
5. to ensure vigorous enforcement of Federal criminal laws to deter and punish trafficking in obscenity, stalking, and harassment by means of AI.

## (c) Protection for “Good Samaritan” blocking and screening of offensive material

1. **Treatment of developer or user**

    No developer or user of an interactive AI service shall be treated as the developer or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.

2. **Civil liability**

    No developer or user of an interactive AI service shall be held liable on account of—

    A. any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the developer or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or
    B. any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph (1).

## (d) Obligations of interactive AI service

A provider of an interactive AI service shall, at the time of entering an agreement with a customer for the provision of an interactive AI service and in a manner deemed appropriate by the provider, notify such customer that control protections (such as open-source models, software, or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist the customer in limiting access to material that is harmful. Such notice shall identify, or provide the customer with access to information identifying, current providers of such protections.
